# Vault Cluster setup

### Requirements

You need to fill in at least values for these two variables:

- `vault_unsealer_host` : IP/FQDN of the manager host where the unsealer container is running.
- `vault_unsealer_token` : The unsealer token generated from the unsealer. This is only generated once during setup. If you don't have it, reinstall the unsealer.
